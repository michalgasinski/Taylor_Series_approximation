# Taylor Series Approximation for a Function

This project demonstrates how to approximate the function 

$$
f(x) = \frac{x^2}{e^x} 
$$ 

using Taylor series expansion. The code provides visualizations comparing the original function and its first and second-order Taylor approximations around a specific point.

# Derivatives
- **First Derivative**: Computes the first derivative of the function using finite difference approximation.
- **Second Derivative**: Computes the second derivative of the function using finite difference approximation.

# Project Overview
The script generates a plot showing:
- The original function \( f(x) \).
- The first-order Taylor series approximation (in red).
- The second-order Taylor series approximation (in blue).

# Visualization
Python's matplotlib is used to visualize the function and its approximations, providing an intuitive understanding of how well the Taylor series approximates the original function near the specified point.
